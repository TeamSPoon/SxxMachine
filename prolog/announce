Announcing jProlog 0.1

	a compiler from Prolog to Java + a Prolog system written in Java


Runs under java version "1.0.2".
The toplevel of jProlog prompts for queries with ?- and shows
variable bindings, like most Prologs.

Features:

	Prolog files are compiled to Java files (*)
	syntax almost Edingburgh (*)
	most Clocksin-Mellish built-ins - almost no I/O
	no consult: predicates are loaded on need according to Java filosophy
	intuitionistic assumption (assume/2)
	backtrackable destructive assignment (setarg/3)
	delayed execution (freeze/2)
	a garbage collector :-)
	...
	No GUI, applets, interface to Netscape ...


We invite you to check out http://people.cs.kuleuven.be/Bart.Demoen/PrologInJava/



(*) lacking an efficient parser, the system isn't bootstrapped yet, i.e.
    the compiler form Prolog to Java is written in Prolog and you need
    a Prolog system (BinProlog - SICStus Prolog ...)


Oh, we almost forgot: the authors are
