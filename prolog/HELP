What you have here should be enough to run the small example that
shows the PrologFromJava interface.

What you should do  - % is the Linux prompt
what appears after a # is comment, the rest part of a session


% javac *.java           # this will cause some warnings that you can
                         # apparently ignore, but at some point you might
                         # want to make them disappear
                         # this command is needed only once of course


% xsb         # will also work: BinProlog, SICStus and probably most others

% java PrologFromJava
